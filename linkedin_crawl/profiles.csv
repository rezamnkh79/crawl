Traditionally, logistics services have been categorized into First-Party (hashtag#1PL) through Fourth-Party Logistics (hashtag#4PL):1PL refers to companies handling their ownhashtag#logisticsandhashtag#supply_chainoperations.2PL involves contracting out transportation and warehousing to external providers.3PL extends this further by outsourcing entire logistics processes, from warehousing to distribution.4PL takes it a step further by managing the entire supply chain on behalf of a company, often integrating multiplehashtag#3PLservices and acting as a single point of contact.Enter 5PL, a concept that builds upon the 4PL model but introduces a new layer of strategic complexity. Unlike its predecessors, 5PL providers focus on managing networks of supply chains, integrating cutting-edge technology and data analytics to optimize global logistics ecosystems.

It includes the transportation, storage, and delivery of raw materials from suppliers to the manufacturing plant or warehouse. Inbound logistics is a crucial component of the overall supply chain as it directly impacts the efficiency and cost of production.The importance of inbound logistics in the cost of production can be seen in several key areas:1.Cost Efficiency: Properly managed inbound logistics can help reduce transportation and storage costs, leading to lower production costs. Streamlining these processes ensures that materials arrive on time and in the correct quantities, preventing overstock or shortages.2.Inventory Management: Effective inbound logistics allows companies to optimize inventory levels, reducing carrying costs and minimizing the need for excess stock, which ties up capital.3.Supplier Relationships: Strong coordination with suppliers can lead to better pricing, improved delivery schedules, and reduced lead times, all of which contribute to cost control.4.Transportation Costs: Choosing the right transportation methods and routes can lead to significant savings in fuel, labor, and time, ultimately reducing the total cost of production.5.Productivity: Efficient inbound logistics ensure that materials are delivered in a timely manner, allowing for smooth production processes, which minimizes delays and production downtime.By focusing on optimizing inbound logistics, businesses can achieve substantial savings, improve operational efficiency, and ultimately enhance their competitiveness in the market.', 'No text', 'No text']"

هر دو اسم در فارسی وجود دارند، اما معنای متفاوتی دارند). مشابه همین اشتباه درباره\u200cی اسمم، در مورد شغلم هم بسیاری تصور می\u200cکنند که من ""Account manager"" هستم، در حالی که \'CampaignManager\'  هستم، و این دو نقش با هم تفاوت\u200cهای زیادی دارند.🔹 Campaign manager : مدیران کمپین، مانند معماران پروژه\u200cهای بازاریابی هستند. وظیفه\u200cی اصلی آنها برنامه\u200cریزی، اجرا و تحلیل داده\u200cهای کمپین\u200cهای بازاریابی است. 🎯 آنها از ابزارهای پیشرفته مثل آنالیتیکس، تگ منیجر، بعضا وردپرس و  پلتفرم های تبلیغات کلیکی استفاده می\u200cکنند تا عملکرد کمپین\u200cها را بهینه\u200cسازی کنند.🔹 Account manager : از سوی دیگر، مدیر حساب بر روی مدیریت روابط با مشتریان تمرکز دارد. او مسئول است تا اطمینان حاصل کند که مشتری\u200cها راضی و نیازهایشان برآورده می\u200cشود. وظایف اصلی او شامل تعامل روزانه، حل مشکلات و تضمین رضایت مشتری در طولانی\u200cمدت است.اما بیایید برای توضیح بیشتر، یک مثال بزنم. تصور کنید یک مدیر فنی که در سطح بالایی از تخصص خود کار می\u200cکند، اگر او را هلپ\u200cدسک صدا بزنید، ممکن است کمی ناراحت شود، درست است؟ البته که نقش هلپ\u200cدسک بسیار مهم است و نباید کوچک شمرده شود، اما برای کسی که سال\u200cها زمان گذاشته و در یک حوزه تخصصی پیشرفت کرده، ترجیح می\u200cدهد که دقیقاً به همان جایگاهی که در آن قرار دارد شناخته شود، نه به\u200cعنوان یک نقش دیگر.همین مسئله برای من و دیگر افراد این پوزیشن کاری هم صدق می\u200cکند. من برای کسب این تخصص\u200cها (مثل تحلیل داده، مدیریت کمپین\u200cهای دیجیتال، استفاده از ابزارهای پیشرفته و ...) زمان و انرژی زیادی صرف کرده\u200cام. به همین دلیل، کاملا حق خودم میدونم که به\u200cعنوان campaign manager معرفی شوم، نهaccount manager !!هر دو نقش در نوع خود بسیار ارزشمند و مهم هستند، اما با وظایف و مهارت\u200cهای متفاوتی همراهند. امیدوارم از این پس بتوانیم با شناخت بهتری به تفاوت این نقش\u200cها احترام بگذاریم.hashtag#KnowYourRolehashtag#DataAnalyticshashtag#CampaignManagerhashtag#performance_marketinghashtag#RoleClarityhashtag#MarketingStrategy', 'I’m happy to share that I’ve been promoted to Senior Campaign Manager atDigify | دیجی\u200cفای!Super happy that i  have achieved what i deserved 💜💜speciall thanks to my managers that trusted me and believed my abilities 💜💜Sahar ZamaniMahyar Aboutorabii won’t disappoint you and i will put in more effortSepideh TaleiRadyou are one of the best Human resources i’ve ever had 💜', 'have you noticed this option before?hashtag#google_analyticshashtag#GTMhashtag#performance_marketinghashtag#campaign_managerhashtag#GA4hashtag#digital_marketing', 'این شما و این تیم پرفورمنس دیجی\u200cفای!🤩این تیم سه نفره، به مدیریت سحر عزیز و همکاری سبا و امین، یکی از تیم\u200cهای کلیدی و بسیار مهم مارکتینگ دیجی\u200cفای محسوب می\u200cشه. بچه\u200cهای این تیم کارشون اجرای انواع کمپین\u200cهای تبلیغاتی دیجیتال برای دیجی\u200cفای و پذیرنده\u200cهاست و یه کار مهم دیگه\u200cای هم که می\u200cکنن اینه که این کمپین\u200cها رو باتوجه به دیتاهایی که دائم در حال بررسی کردنشون هستن، بهبود می\u200cدن. از کمپین\u200cهای تبلیغات بنری و کلیکی گرفته تا سئو، مسئولیتش با تیم پرفورمنسه و همین باعث می\u200cشه که سرشون همیشه شلوغ باشه و به قول معروف، وقت سر خاروندن نداشته باشن.بچه\u200cهای این تیم همونطور که گفتیم تمرکزشون روی اجرای انواع کمپین\u200cهای تبلیغاتی دیجیتاله. سبا، کارشناس ارشد کمپین، روی کمپین\u200cهای تبلیغاتی برای پذیرنده\u200cها کار می\u200cکنه و امین، کارشناس سئو، پروژه\u200cهای مختلف سئوی پذیرنده\u200cها رو جلو می\u200cبره. سحر هم وظیفه\u200cی هدایت بچه\u200cها رو به عهده داره و همزمان، کارهای سئو و کمپین\u200cهای تبلیغاتی خود دیجی\u200cفای رو پیش می\u200cبره و توی این مسیر از بچه\u200cها هم هر جا که لازم باشه، کمک می\u200cگیره.تیم خوب پرفورمنس دیجی\u200cفای همیشه در حال تبادل دانش با همدیگه هستن و خیلی برای یادگیری و پیشرفت مشتاقن. همیشه می\u200cبینیم که انواع دوره\u200cها رو می\u200cگذرونن تا دانششون رو به\u200cروز نگه دارن و به همدیگه هم یاد می\u200cدن و از همدیگه یاد می\u200cگیرن. این ویژگی مثبت و خیلی کارآمدی توی کارشونه و باعث می\u200cشه تیم پرفورمنس همیشه روش\u200cهای جدیدی برای اجرای کمپین\u200cها داشته باشن و در حال تست و بررسی نتایج باشن.هر چقدر از اهمیت کاری که بچه\u200cها می\u200cکنن بخوایم بگیم، بازم حق مطلب ادا نمی\u200cشه. از این فرصت استفاده می\u200cکنیم و ازشون برای تمام زحماتی که می\u200cکشن، تشکر می\u200cکنیم و امیدواریم هر روز توی مسیر بهبود و پیشرفت باشیم؛ در کنار هم.hashtag#دیجیفایhashtag#پرفورمنس_مارکتینگhashtag#منابع_انسانیhashtag#performancemarketinghashtag#humanresource', '✨ بازاریابی دیجیتال در ایران؛ چشم\u200cاندازی به رشد و تحول ✨به عنوان یک متخصص دیجیتال مارکتینگ، همیشه به دنبال بینش\u200cها و داده\u200cهای جدید هستم تا بهتر بتوانم استراتژی\u200cهای موثری برای کسب\u200cوکارها طراحی کنم. به تازگی گزارشی جامع و بسیار جذاب از یکتانت منتشر شده است که به بررسی وضعیت بازاریابی دیجیتال در ایران پرداخته. این گزارش شامل اطلاعات ارزشمندی درباره رفتار کاربران ایرانی، روندهای نوظهور در تبلیغات و تغییرات بازار دیجیتال است که برای هر بازاریابی ضروری است.💡چند نکته جالب از این گزارش:1️⃣ رشد چشمگیر تبلیغات دیجیتال در سال ۱۴۰۲، تبلیغات دیجیتال بیش از ۲۰٪ از کل حجم تبلیغات در ایران را تشکیل داده است! این یعنی کسب\u200cوکارها به خوبی به اهمیت حضور آنلاین پی برده\u200cاند و بخش بزرگی از بودجه تبلیغاتی خود را به این فضا اختصاص داده\u200cاند.2️⃣رفتار آنلاین کاربران: بیش از ۸۵٪ کاربران قبل از خرید حضوری یا آنلاین، در اینترنت تحقیق می\u200cکنند. این موضوع نشان می\u200cدهد که بازاریابی محتوا و SEO هنوز هم جزو مهم\u200cترین عوامل موفقیت در جذب مخاطبان است.3️⃣افزایش تعامل در شبکه\u200cهای اجتماعی: تعامل کاربران در اینستاگرام فارسی به شکل چشمگیری رشد کرده است. با رشد ۲۹.۵٪ در تعداد پست\u200cها و ۸۶٪ در تعداد لایک\u200cها نسبت به سال گذشته، اینستاگرام همچنان یکی از اصلی\u200cترین پلتفرم\u200cهای ارتباط با مخاطبان است. پست\u200cهایی به شکل ریلز و همچنین عکس\u200cنوشته\u200cها، درصد بالایی از نرخ تعامل و جذابیت را به خود اختصاص داده\u200cاند. این قالب\u200cهای محتوایی به وضوح نشان می\u200cدهند که محتوای بصری خلاقانه همچنان پرطرفدارترین است.4️⃣ بهترین زمان برای تبلیغات آنلاین: یکی از نکات جذاب دیگر این است که بهترین ساعتی که می\u200cتوانید تبلیغات آنلاین خود را در پلتفرم\u200cهای کلیکی شروع کنید، بین 2 بعد از ظهر تا 10 شب هست.🔍 پیشنهاد شخصی من: به\u200cجای خاموش و روشن کردن کمپین که ممکن است به عملکرد و تاریخچه آن آسیب بزند، از تنظیمات پنالتی ساعت استفاده کنید. یا حداقل فقط در یکی از بازه\u200cهای زمانی پیشنهادی کمپین خود را استارت بزنید، زیرا خاموش و روشن کردن مکرر، می\u200cتواند اثر منفی بر کمپین داشته باشد.این گزارش جذاب رو پیشنهاد میکنم از لینک زیر حتما بخونیدhttps://lnkd.in/duvKvdXeاگرم خوندید که منتظر خوندن نظرات خوبتون هستم💛', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text', 'No text']"
